# Parkinsons-Disease

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting Parkinson's disease using various data mining and modeling techniques. The project encompasses exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, data mining, and data modeling processes. The goal is to develop a reliable predictive model that can assist in diagnosing Parkinson's disease.

# Project Overview
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and coordination. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to build a predictive model capable of accurately diagnosing Parkinson's disease based on relevant data features. The process involves several steps, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, data mining, and data modeling.

EDA allows us to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distributions of variables, detect anomalies, and identify potential correlations between features. Feature engineering focuses on transforming the raw data into meaningful and representative features that can enhance the performance of our models. Data mining involves extracting relevant information from the dataset to inform the modeling process. Finally, data modeling refers to the construction and evaluation of machine learning models using the prepared data.
